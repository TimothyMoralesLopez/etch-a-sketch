This is my Etch-a-Sketch project. I am a bit anxious for this project, as it heavily utilizes CSS and flexbox, and I realize that that is the area in coding and programming that I am the weakest in. However, I am looking forward to getting to the point where I can complete the project and strengthen my CSS skills. 

This is my Etch-a-Sketch project - completed! This project was not as difficult as I anticipated. I did struggle a bit with the CSS and flexbox as I expected. However, utilizing online resources, I was able to solve the problem. The other thing that I struggled with was the combining of CSS and JavaScript. It's my tendency to always separate my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their respective files as much as I possibly can. However, in this case, it proved difficult to completely separate them all. In the end, I was able to keep the majority of each separated in their own individual file. This was definitely a learning experience that I think will greatly help as I continue with my career in web development.
